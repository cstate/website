    <p>Hi! cState was started by (at the time) a 16-year-old student and creative from Lithuania. ðŸ‡±ðŸ‡¹ Since as early as 2016,
       I have been learning about digital design and web development on my own. If you want to help support me in my journey,
       please donate on GitHub Sponsors (there are various tiers and amounts) or commisison a custom project.</p>
